        <p>
            Conversational bots (chatbots) provide a natural way for human to interact with the computer. 
            <a href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt">ChatGPT</a>, or other GPT-based tools such as <a href="https://github.com/features/copilot">Github Copilot</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/codewandai?lang=en">Codewand</a>, is an impressive chatbot; however, it remains just a chatbot. 
            Its capabilities are restricted to providing answers based on the prompts it receives. 
            Thus, while it can achieve remarkable feats, including building software with natural language, it can do so only under human guidance.
        </p>
        <p>
            Such feats might lead people to mistakenly believe that "Well I will just ask ChatGPT to do it" nowadays. 
            However, they see only the impressive outcomes, overlooking the process required to achieve these results. 
            In other words, these impressive outcomes merely represent the culmination of a long process that involves substantial thinking, analysis, design, and optimization. 
            ChatGPT itself is not a silver bullet that reduces the inherent complexity of tasks, nor is it a shortcut that bypasses the process. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Although ChatGPT can provide a wealth of information and suggestions, as one end of human-AI collaboration, it remains human-driven. 
            ChatGPT's capabilities depend on human expertise, judgment, and creativity that drives the interaction process. This means people need to have a good understanding of the relevant domain and know how to effectively communicate with ChatGPT, when to consult it for what, and how to pose effective prompts and discover them. 
            However, ChatGPT itself does not directly support the systematization of this process.
        </p>
        <p>
            Unlike ChatGPT, Prompt Sapper emphasizes the importance of the analysis and design process and introduces <a href="promptmanship.html">software engineering concepts and methodology</a> to standardize and explicitly support this process. 
            Prompt Sapper integrates chatbots to support the natural human-AI interaction.
            However, it employs various intelligent co-pilots that proactively assist humans in acquiring knowledge, analyzing requirements, and designing AI chains, rather than passively following human instructions.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            If we consider large language models as "operating systems", then ChatGPT would be the command line console, while Prompt Sapper would be the integrated development environment.
