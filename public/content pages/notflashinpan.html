            Programming is essentially the means of humans communicating with computers. Previously, we have to adapt to the computer and interact with it using <b>programming languages</b> that the computer can understand, even though natural language is the most intuitive way to express our intentions. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The advent of large language models is chaning the way we can interact and
            communiate with the computers. 
            Now, we can write a <b>natural language prompt</b> with instructions and examples, and the model will understand this natural language "program", and then get the task done.
            Prompt programming frees people from traditional programming and AI training.
            This allows (non-technical) individuals to create complex and specialized AI services by chaining prompt-based AI functionalities on top of foundation models, which we can <b>AI chains</b> (see <a href="aichainexamples.html">AI chain examples</a> from the literature and explore our <a href="showcases/showcases.html">AI chain showcases</a>).
        </p>
        <p>
            Compositional AI is no new concept, but AI chain is a new capability unlocked by foundation models that provide a flexible and versatile basis for composing new AI systems, where people can focus on "<b>what to do</b>", i.e., analyzing task workflow and data characteristics, and designing human-AI interaction through natural language, rather than focusing on "how to do", i.e., data structures, algorithms, API calls, data labeling, and model training.
        </p-->
        <p>
            As the capabilities of models continue to improve, will we soon no longer need AI chain technology, especially considering the impressive abilities of recent autonomous agent frameworks (such as <a href="https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT">AutoGPT</a>)?
        </p>
        <p>
            In the recent article <a href="http://kns.cnki.net/kcms/detail/11.1777.TP.20230414.1444.003.html">ChatGPT: A Glimpse into AIâ€™s Future</a>, Sang and Yu project the AI's awareness and capabilities in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johari_window">Johari window</a>, which consists of four quadrants: open, blind, hidden, and unknown.
            As the capabilities of models and self-awareness improve, there will certainly be more abilities absorbed into the open quadrant.
            We believe this will result in a left-shift in <a href="aichainconcepts.html">worker-AI interaction modes</a>. 
            Prompts would be less sensitive to writing variations.
            For a task that previously required a higher-level interaction mode, it would now be completed with a lower-level interaction mod. 
            Or, tasks that previously required a complex AI chain could now be completed with a simpler AI chain.
            At the same time, some tasks that previous weaker models could not handle can be completed with AI chains and stronger models.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, we do not think this left-shifting means AI chain concepts and methods will become irrelevant as the model capabilities scale up.
            No matter how much the capabilities of models improve, there will always be hidden, blind, and unknown quadrants.
            AI chain is a fundamental strategy for determining ability boundaries between the open and hidden quadrants and expanding ability range between the open and blind quadrants, rather than a specific AI capability that could be absorbed by the large language models.
        </p>
        <p>
            For example, through backward reasoning chain, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.13894">LAMBADA</a> more accurately determined the model's ability to solve complex reasoning tasks that were originally prone to errors.
            <a href="https://react-lm.github.io/">ReAct</a> narrows blind spots by combining two fundamental abilities: reasoning and action, such as overcoming the common hallucination problem in Chain-of-Thoughts by searching Wikipedia through APIs.
            <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11366">Reflection</a> introduces self-reflection agent to ReAct, allowing for the exploration of roblem-solving abilities through trial and error.
        </p>
        <p>
            While autonomous agents (such as <a href="https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT">AutoGPT</a>) possess strong abilities in task planning, execution, and reflection, they cannot replace the concept and production tool of AI chain.
            First, they are themselves AI chains and their design and development require the support of AI chain production tools.
            Second, the continuous improvement of model capabilities has brought about the problem of "moving sand".
            In addition, the overall model improvement does not necessarily mean that all task abilities are improved.
            Some <a href="https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/how-not-to-test-gpt-3">experiments</a> have shown that new models may even perform worse in simple tasks. 
            This "moving sand" problem brings a great deal of uncertainty and unpredictability to the behavior of autonomous agents, as these agents are not software production tools themselves. 
            In contrast, the AI chain production tool we propose is built on a transparent software process and methodology, adhering to core values such as modular design, reusability, debuggability, and composability in software engineering. This enables the development of AI services to be more robust and predictable in the face of model "moving sand" problems.
        </p>

        <p>
            In summary, we do not think AI chain and its production tool will become a flash in the pan even though LLMs demonstrate stronger and stronger capabilities in knowledge encoding, planning and evern writing code.
            This is because AI chain is a fundamental strategy for solving complex problems and a software engineering methdology on top of foundation models, rather than a specific AI capability which could be absorbed by LLMs.
            We believe stronger LLMs will make AI chain more powerful and AI chain production tool more efficient.

            We believe that this article provides a profound understanding of the relationship and collaboration between humans and AI, and is very useful for understanding and positioning the significance and role of AI chains.

        <!--img class="main-figure" src="../image/figures/Evolution.jpg">
        <p class="figure-caption">Figure 2: Evolution of Machine Learning and Software Paradigms</p>

        <p>
            To understand the transformative impact of foundation models, prompt programming and AI chain, it is important to consider the evolution of machine learning (ML) and software paradigms (as illustrated in Figure 2)
        </p>
        
        <p>
            In the pre-neural-network era, machine learning involved feature engineering, where experts would hand-craft features to be used as inputs to the model. 
            This was followed by architecture engineering, which involved designing neural network architectures (e.g., CNN, LSTM, Transformer) to learn the features and logic from data. 
            The next step was objective engineering, which focused on defining the loss functions used to optimize and fine-tune the model (e.g., fine-tune BERT for downstream tasks). 
        </p>
        <p>
            However, these traditional paradigms (pre-NN ML and AI 1.0) had limitations, such as the need for significant expertise in data engineering, modeling, and other technical skills.
            Furthermore, in these paradigms, models were trained on specific tasks and lacked the flexibility to be combined with other models.
            This means that there was a lack of an "operating system" model to support the development, assembly, and ecosystem of AI services. 
            The foundation models have brought about earth-shaking changes and is regarded as AI 2.0.
            They have cross-domain knowledge and can adapt to various complex tasks through in-context learning, bringing us the long-awaited <b>"operating system" effects</b>.
        </p>        
        <p>    
            By using foundation models through AI chain and prompt programming, individuals, including non-technical people, can leverage these models in their life and work, without the need for significant technical expertise.
            By adapting pre-trained models and compose them in novel ways, developers can save time and resources in developing AI systems, while also improving accuracy by leveraging the vast knowledge captured in foundation models. 
            By leveraging the power of foundation models and AI chains, organizations can create more efficient and effective workflows, automate repetitive tasks, and make more informed and data-driven decisions. 
            Moreover, AI chain can facilitate cross-industry collaboration by enabling the sharing and composition of AI modules. 
            This can lead to the development of more powerful and specialized AI systems, which can benefit multiple industries and domains.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            In the traditional ML paradigm, AI expertise has been concentrated within AI engineers and software developers. 
            However, foundation models have the potential to empower non-AI/software experts to directly create functioning AI prototypes, conceive of new ML use cases, and use those proofs-of-concept to communicate with collaborators. 
            This shift in <b>who can prototype with AI</b> may lead to a parallel shift in <b>what non-AI practitioners do when prototyping</b> (<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3503564">Jiang et al. 2022</a>). 
            They may begin to prototype more deeply, considering issues such as handling AI failures, and borrowing practices from software engineering for debugging and testing prompts and AI chains. 
            This will create a new hybrid between software engineering, UI/UX design and AI such that future AI-based features and products can be more rapidly iterated on and de-risked earlier in the product cycle, since more people have the ability to test out ideas, and in less time (<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3503564">Jiang et al. 2022</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.06566">Wu et al. 2022</a>).

            Kai-Fu Lee believes chatbots and text-to-image creation are just the tip of the iceberg of AI 2.0, and we should not limit our imagination of the potential of AI 2.0. 
            <b>With the emergence of AI 2.0, enter Software 3.0</b>. 
            Software 3.0 is essentially distinct from Software 1.0, which emphasizes algorithms, features, and APIs, and Software 2.0, which is centered on datasets, neural network structures, and learning objectives. 
            With human-centric <b>prompt programming and AI chain at the core of Software 3.0</b>, Andrej Karpathy predicted that the number of "programmers" could potentially expand to 1.5 billion. 
            We have seen this trend in the job market, for example, with Boston Childrenâ€™s Hospital recruiting "AI Prompt Engineers" to help write scripts for analyzing healthcare data in research and clinical practice, and Mishcon de Reya, one of Londonâ€™s largest law firms, hiring "Legal Prompt Engineer" to design prompt-based legal services on top of ChatGPT. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Foundation models, prompt programming, and AI chains are opening up new possibilities for AI development and application (again, see <a href="aichainexamples.html">AI chain examples</a> from the literature and explore our <a href="showcases/showcases.html">AI Chain showcases</a>). 
            It offers the potential to democratize AI, making AI accessible to a wider range of individuals and organizations. 
            It also offers the potential for more efficient, accurate, and specialized AI services, which can have a significant impact on a wide range of industries and domains. 
            This trend has further accelerated with the significant reduction in foundation model API costs, giving rise to new AI services and business models that not only benefit more people from these AI services but also enable more people to become creators of AI services.
