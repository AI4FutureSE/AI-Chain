        <p>
            In the AI 1.0 era, AI expertise has been mastered by AI or software engineers. 
            AI 2.0, which emerged from the foundation models, has the potential to empower non-AI or software experts to directly conceive AI service use cases and create AI prototypes. 
            However, developing chatbots, agent frameworks, or other AI services based on foundation models still requires programming languages (such as Python) to invoke the models or model APIs, which undoubtedly offsets the democratization effect brought by the foundation models.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Although autonomous agent frameworks have demonstrated the potential to generate software applications from natural language, as described in <a href="sappervsautoagent.html">Sapper vs. AutoGPT</a>, these frameworks are not software production tools. They have many limitations and challenges in terms of economic aspects, security, and controllability.
        </p>

        <p>
            Recently, several programming frameworks aimed at developing foundation model based applications have been proposed, including             
            <a href="https://dust.tt/">Dust</a>, <a href="https://primer.ought.org/">Primer</a>, and the most popular, <a href="https://langchain.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html}">LangChain</a>. 
            These frameworks simplify the development foundation model based applications by abstracting and encapsulating concepts such as model, agent, index, and memory, thereby providing support for SE4AI. 
            However, this SE4AI support is limited to the application implementation phase, and the target users are still individuals with certain computing and programming skills, making it easier for them to implement foundation model based applications.

        </p>

        <p>
            Prompt Sapper has implemented a programming framework similar to LangChain in the backend to implement and run AI chains. 
            Unlike these programming-oriented frameworks, Prompt Sapper provides the whole-process support for foundation model based AI service development, including requirements, design, implementation, and testing. 
            In the implementation phase corresponding to the programming-oriented frameworks, Prompt Sapper uses block-based visual programming (no-code programming) to allow non-technical users to more intuitively understand AI chain concepts and visually build AI chains. 
        </p>
        <p>
            We want to emphasize that Prompt Sapper's support for SE4AI goes far beyond visual programming, as we propose a comprehensive AI chain methodology and corresponding tools. 
            More importantly, Prompt Sapper not only includes SE4AI but also AI4SE, thus forming an effective AI4SE4AI closed loop. 
            The AI4SE part of Prompt Sapper utilizes LLM-based co-pilots that are human-oriented rather than programming-oriented. 
            These co-pilots assist people in understanding tasks, analyzing requirements, generating AI chain skeletons, and testing AI chains throughout the AI chain development process, which goes beyond simple visual programming to further lower the requirement for computing and programming skills.
