            Prompt Sapper draws inspiration from many outstanding projects and tools, but it has significant differences from them in several key aspects, including:
        </p>

        <h2 class="main-subtitle">Balanced Human-AI teamwork</h2>
        <p>
            Prompt Sapper emphasizes the collaborative interaction between artificial intelligence and human users. 
            It seamlessly marries human intelligence with artificial intelligence through AI chains, effectively addressing complex problems and achieving shared goals. 
            This human-AI team work fosters enhanced overall efficiency, reduced error rates, and empowers human users to fully harness the potential of AI. 
            This distinctive approach sets Prompt Sapper apart from existing human-driven conversational bots (e.g., <a href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt">ChatGPT</a>) and AI-dominated agent frameworks (e.g., <a href="https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT">AutoGPT</a>), highlighting its innovative and unique value proposition.
        </p>

        <h2 class="main-subtitle">Low requirements for computing and programming skills</h2>
        <p>
            Compared to other projects, Prompt Sapper significantly lowers the barrier to entry for creating complex AI services tailored to user needs. 
            It introduces a suite of LLM-based virtual product manager, architect, and prompt engineer to assist users in acquiring domain knowledge, analyzing task requirements, and constructing AI chains. 
            Additionally, Prompt Sapper provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface, enabling users to effortlessly interact with AI and prototype AI functionalities without the need for advanced computing or programming skills. 
            This approach broadens the specturm of people able to benefit from the advancements in artificial intelligence and underscoring the distinct position of Prompt Sapper in the AI landscape.
        </p>
        
        <h2 class="main-subtitle">Systematic framework for AI4SE4AI</h2>
        <p>
            Prompt Sapper values the close integration of software engineering and artificial intelligence, striving to create a systematic AI4SE4AI framework. 
            Within this framework, Prompt Sapper leverages AI technology to significantly improve the efficiency of software engineering processes, such as requirements analysis, AI chain design, construction, and testing. At the same time, Prompt Sapper adheres to and expands upon the best practices of software engineering to adapt to the new software landscape driven by AI 2.0 and Software 3.0. 
            This AI4SE4AI framework not only substantially enhances the development efficiency and project quality of AI services but also supports flexible service reuse and assembly, as well as continuous improvement and optimization of AI services to meet ever-changing demands.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            In conclusion, as a unique project, Prompt Sapper distinguishes itself from numerous excellent projects by emphasizing human-AI teamwork, lowering requirements for computing and programming skills, and providing a systematic framework for AI4SE4AI.
