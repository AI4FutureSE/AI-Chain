        <h2 class="main-subtitle"><b>EXPLORATIONS WITH LLM</b></h2>
        <p>
            Now, we will describe how we learn task knowledge from LLM, experiment with task prompt effectiveness, and summarize the challenges faced and advantages gained after using LLM.
        </p>
        <h2 class="main-subtitle">Discourse with LLM</h2>
        <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;Some Exploratory research was carried out with LLM to understand the knowledge needs. Through these experiments (Sometimes, Xin Xiao Zhu makes mistakes in judgment or gives suggestions that do not meet the user's symptoms. Therefore, I set the Xin Xiao Zhu output to be specific to the user's symptoms, and if the user is not satisfied with the output, I can request a new output until the user is satisfied.), I have found that using large language models can improve the accuracy of diagnosis and treatment, and provide more specific treatment recommendations and measures. This provides more powerful capabilities and advantages for our software Xin Xiao Zhu.
        </p>
         <h2 class="main-subtitle">Challenges</h2>
        <p>
             &nbsp;&nbsp;When it comes to psychological therapy services, LLM may face challenges in terms of requiring more precise data and knowledge to effectively meet users' needs. Additionally, since counseling involves users' personal psychological health issues, AI chains must address challenges related to user privacy and security in their design. Therefore, it is crucial to consider how to protect user privacy and security while providing efficient services when designing an AI chain for psychological therapy.
        </p>
         <h2 class="main-subtitle">Advantages</h2>
        <p>
             &nbsp;&nbsp;Xin Xiao Zhu's use of large language models allows for efficient and accurate processing of large amounts of user data, allowing for more effective identification and treatment of psychological issues. With continuous learning and improvement through AI technology, Xin Xiao Zhu can adapt and evolve to meet the changing needs of its users, improving its overall effectiveness over time. This not only benefits end-users but also enables mental health professionals to deliver more personalized and effective care. Furthermore, Xin Xiao Zhu's use of technology allows for greater accessibility, making psychological therapy services more widely available to those who may have difficulty accessing traditional in-person therapy sessions.
        </p>
        <h2 class="main-subtitle"><b>AI-CHAIN DESIGN</b></h2>
        <p>
            Next, let me introduce my AI chain design and major features.

         <h2 class="main-subtitle"><b>USER FEEDBACK FOR SAPPER AND XIN XIAO ZHU'S FUTURE DEVELOPMENT</b></h2>
        <h2 class="main-subtitle">Sapper</h2>
        <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;Sapper is a highly promising AI integrated development environment (IDE) designed especially for those who lack a computer science background. With its no-code programming and graphical drag-and-drop development, users can quickly develop various artificial intelligence applications. The emergence of this tool has addressed the application challenges of AI technology, increasing work efficiency and creating more opportunities for local economic growth.<br >
            &nbsp;&nbsp;The launch of Sapper has provided a more convenient way for people to create their own AI applications, enabling intelligent processing in various scenarios. It is an important step towards integrating AI technology into people's daily lives, and in the future, it will continue to be upgraded and improved to provide users with even better services and experiences.

        <h2 class="main-subtitle">Potential Development Direction of Xin Xiao Zhu</h2>
            <ul>
  <li><p>More language support: Currently, Xin Xiao Zhu only supports Chinese, but in the future, it could expand its services globally by supporting other major languages such as English, Spanish, French, and others. This would increase accessibility to its services for Non-Chinese speaking users, potentially reaching a broader user base and impacting more individuals worldwide.</p ></li>
  <li><p>Multimedia support: Currently, Xin Xiao Zhu primarily relies on questionnaires for diagnosis and treatment, but in the future, it could explore integrating more multimedia elements, such as voice, images, and videos, to provide more personalized and intuitive treatment suggestions. This could potentially enhance user engagement and make the platform more interactive, leading to more effective treatment outcomes.</p ></li>
  <li><p>Application scenario expansion: In addition to serving mental health professionals and patients, Xin Xiao Zhu could expand into other fields, such as internal human resource management of enterprises, education and training, and more, to provide intelligent auxiliary solutions for different industries. This could potentially increase the platform's impact and open up new revenue streams.</p ></li>
  <li><p>Data privacy protection: With the increasing number of data leaks and misuse, protecting user data privacy has become a crucial issue. In the future, Xin Xiao Zhu could enhance user data privacy protection by strengthening data encryption and security controls. This would help to ensure that user data is kept confidential and secure, building trust with its users and potentially increasing user retention.</p ></li>
  <li><p>Human-machine interaction interface: Although Xin Xiao Zhu has provided good diagnostic and treatment functions, its human-machine interaction interface could be further improved. In the future, Xin Xiao Zhu could explore more natural and intelligent interaction methods, such as voice interaction, image recognition, and others, to enhance the user experience and treatment effects. This could potentially increase user engagement and satisfaction with the platform, leading to improved treatment outcomes.</p ></li>
  <li><p>Responsibility and ethical considerations: As an AI-powered mental health assistant, Xin Xiao Zhu carries the responsibility to ensure that its services are provided ethically and responsibly. In the future, the platform could explore incorporating more ethical considerations into its decision-making processes, such as transparency in data collection and use, ensuring user consent for data usage, and avoiding potential biases in diagnosis and treatment suggestions. This would help to build trust with users and ensure that the platform operates in a responsible and ethical manner, ultimately benefiting both mental health professionals and patients.</p ></li>
