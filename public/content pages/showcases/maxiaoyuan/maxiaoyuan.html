        <h2><b>What's Code Little Ape ?</b></h2>
        <p style="text-indent:2em">
            Code Little Ape is an innovative, AI-powered tool specifically designed to assist individuals who are
            learning to code, enabling them to rapidly acquire and master programming skills. By leveraging the power of
            artificial intelligence and machine learning, this cutting-edge platform adapts to each user's unique
            learning style, offering personalized guidance and support throughout the learning process.
        </p>
        <h2><b>Why do I develop Code Little Ape ?</b></h2>
        <p style="text-indent:2em">
            As a computer programming major in college, I am learning about programming. I find that learning code is
            not easy for programming learners. I often encounter problems that I cannot solve, and even with the help of
            search engines, it takes a lot of time to find solutions. This wastes a lot of time and makes learning code
            boring. In order to make learning more efficient and convenient, I tried using Chat GPT for assistance. I
            found that GPT has an amazing accuracy for basic and some intermediate to advanced code. Therefore, I used
            the API provided by Chat GPT, and based on my experience with GPT and the patterns I have summarized, I
            developed Code Little Ape using AI Chain technology. This allows more people to enjoy the convenience of
            GPT, and I hope more people will join the development of AI Chain.
        </p>
        <h2><b>Who is Code Little Ape facing towards?</b></h2>
        <p style="text-indent:2em">
            Code Little Ape is targeted towards computer programming learners, students, and enthusiasts who are looking
            for a more efficient and convenient way to learn and solve coding problems. The tool aims to help users by
            leveraging the power of Chat GPT, making their programming journey more enjoyable and less time-consuming.
        </p>
        <h2><b>How did I develop Code Little Ape</b></h2>
        <p>
            The development of Code Little Ape is not always smooth sailing.
        <h2>The initial exploration:</h2>
        <p style="text-indent:2em">
            At first, I created a small Q&A module that could accept my questions and output answers. However, it wasn't
            very useful because the answers from GTP were often misleading and incorrect for some questions. To solve
            these problems, I tried adding more modules to correct this issue. But as I made more and more changes, the
            running time increased significantly. Eventually, I had to find a new solution.
        </p>
        <h2>The new solution: </h2>
        <p style="text-indent: 2em">
            My solution was to use AI Chain technology. With AI Chain technology, I was able to modularly design Code
            Little Ape. I summarized my experience in instructions, context, examples, output format, etc., and refined
            it using the rapid building feature of Sapper. With the lessons learned from previous failures, I quickly
            completed the construction of Code Little Ape and debugged it using Sapper, with perfect results. Through AI
            Chain and Sapper, everyone can quickly build their own ideas.
        </p>
        <h2><b>How does Code Little Ape work?</b></h2>
        <p style="text-indent:2em">
            The AI-chain design for "Code Little Ape" is a multi-layered system that streamlines user interaction, core
            functionality, and specialized worker modules to efficiently facilitate code generation, analysis, learning,
            and optimization.
        </p>

        <img class="main-figure" src="picture1.svg">
        <p class="figure-caption">Figure-1: AI Chain of Code Little Ape</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>
            <b>The above image illustrates how Code Little Ape uses AI Chain to implement its code learning assistance
                functionality. Taking the Problem Handing module as an example:</b>
        </p>
        <dr style=" text-indent: 2em">
            First, you can input your question or code, and the system will automatically determine and direct the
            question to the appropriate module. Each module runs from left to right. When a question enters the question
            module, AI Chain wraps the question and sends it to Chat GTP. At this point, Chat GTP returns the
            problem-solving approach. AI Chain will then repackage the approach and send it back to Chat GTP to obtain
            the corresponding code for the problem. The returned code is then passed to the code processing module.
        </dr>
        <p style="text-indent: 2em">
            In the code processing module, I added a judgment component that requires users to evaluate the outputted
            code and decide whether or not to modify it. It's okay if you don't understand the code, as it will be
            analyzed before any modifications are made. In this way, AI Chain technology can accurately produce the
            desired output.
        </p>

        <p style="text-indent: 2em">
            The user interface of Code Little Ape is very simple. It consists of an input text and an output text.
