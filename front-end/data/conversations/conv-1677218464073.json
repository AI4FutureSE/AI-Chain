Data and algorithm bias - The data used for training algorithms and the algorithms themselves may introduce bias and unfairness in the results produced. This may lead to inaccurate results and violates the principle of accountability.2. Automated decision making - Systems may make automated decisions without sufficient checks and balances that can lead to unfair and even unethical outcomes. This could also violate the principle of accountability.3. Lack of transparency - AI systems often lack transparency, which makes it difficult to trace errors or faulty decisions.Ultimately, organizations and developers are accountable for the accuracy of any AI systemâ€™s results. Developers should design systems to be transparent and auditable and install checks and balances to reduce the risk of bias and errors. Organizations should also take responsibility for AI systems by regularly monitoring their performance.\"]}]}"
