            This paper defines the concept of AI chain and promotes the prac-
            tice of AI chain engineering. The advent of foundation models,
            especially large language models, has unlocked a new program-
            ming paradigm that allows us to write natural language prompts
            that program foundation models to do various tasks. Chaining
            prompt-based AI functionalities on top of foundation models can
            develop complex real-world applications with lower effort and less
            time. However, people tend to focus on flashy prompts rather than
            systematic AI chain engineering, which is reminiscent of the era
            before software engineering, when individuals engaged in egoistic
            programming practices. This paper introduces the best principles
            and practices that have been accumulated in software engineering
            for decades into AI chain engineering, such as rapid prototyping, re-
            quirements analysis, structured programming, and design patterns.
            It also develops a no-code integrated development environment,
            Prompt Sapper, which embodies these AI chain engineering prin-
            ciples and patterns naturally in the process of building AI chains,
            thereby improving the performance and quality of AI chains.

            With Prompt Sapper, AI chain engineers can compose prompt-based AI
            services on top of foundation models through chat-based require-
            ment analysis and visual programming. The AI services can be
            deployed as web services to provide services to end users through
            websites or mobile applications. They can also be embedded in
            large software projects or other design and development environ-
            ments (e.g, Figma) to facilitate rapid AI functionality prototyping.
            We report a variety of application cases built on Prompt Sapper,
            from coding assistant, literacy and science education, text-based
            role-playing game development, and robotic process automation.
            We envision the development direction of AI chain engineering
            (e.g., AI chain DevOps, AI service marketplace) and the enhance-
            ment of Prompt Sapperâ€™s functionality (e.g., AI chain debugging,
            responsible AI chain engineering)
