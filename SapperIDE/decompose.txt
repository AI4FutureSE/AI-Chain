A user is interacting with a large language model. They are crafting prompts and giving them to the LLM in order to get the model to complete a task or generate output.

In order for a large language model to better complete tasks or generate outputs, task requirements need to be decomposed.

The decomposed subtasks can interact with a large language model like a human thought chain, reflecting data flow and control flow.
