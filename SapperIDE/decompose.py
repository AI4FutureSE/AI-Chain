</Requirement Description>

<Decomposed steps>
To achieve this function, you can follow the following steps to analyze and design the process:

(Step1 Input: None Output: API_Interface_Selection)
First, you need to choose an API interface used to obtain weather information. You can select some open weather APIs, such as OpenWeatherMap, AccuWeather, etc.

(Step2 Input: API_Interface_Selection Output: API_Key)
After selecting the API interface, you need to configure the API key to access the API. Generally, the API provider will provide a key, which can be found in the API documentation.

(Step3 Input: API_Key Output: Weather_Data)
Use the API key to access the API to get the weather data of the day. The data format is usually JSON or XML.

(Step4 Input: Weather_Data Output: Parsed_Data_Structure)
Parse the obtained JSON or XML format data into easy-to-handle data structures, such as dictionaries or objects.

(Step5 Input: Parsed_Data_Structure Output: Weather_Type)
Judge the weather type of the day according to the description information in the weather data. It can be classified according to weather conditions, such as sunny, cloudy and rainy days.

(Step6 Input: Weather_Type Output: RGB_Color_Value)
In order to generate paintings that meet weather conditions, you need to map the weather type to the corresponding RGB color value. You can map sunny days to blue tones, rainy days to gray tones, and snowy days to white tones.

(Step7 Input: Weather_Type&RGB_Color_Value Output: Painting)
Generate 500x500 pixel paintings according to weather type and corresponding RGB color values. For rainy days, you can generate abstract paintings, and for sunny days, you can generate natural landscape paintings.

(Step8 Input: Painting Output: Display_Painting)
Display the generated paintings to users to improve user experience and entertainment.
