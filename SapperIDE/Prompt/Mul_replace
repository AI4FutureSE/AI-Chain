Choose the relation between the two APIs based on the knowledge of APIs.
Relations:
- function similarity: two API entities have similar usage.
- behavior difference: two API entities have similar usage and different behaves.
- function replace: one API entity can be replaced by another API entity in some specific condition.
- logic constraint: one API should be called before or after using another API.
- efficiency comparison: two API entity have efficiency comparison in some specific conditions.
- unknow: Not the above relation.

API Knowledge:
The available scenarios of java.util.concurrent.BlockingQueue.take(): need to retrieve an element from a queue and wait if the queue is empty, it blocks until an element is available or until the specified timeout has elapsed.
The unavailable scenarios of java.util.concurrent.BlockingQueue.poll(): need to wait for an element to be available in the queue before retrieving it.
Relation between java.util.concurrent.BlockingQueue.take() and java.util.concurrent.BlockingQueue.poll(): java.util.concurrent.BlockingQueue.take() can blocks until an element is available before retrieving it. So the relation is function replace.

API Knowledge:
The available scenarios of java.lang.Object.notify(): want to wake up a single thread that is waiting on the object's monitor.
The unavailable scenarios of java.lang.Object.wait(): do not have the object's lock; do not want the current thread to be interrupted by another thread.
Relation between java.lang.Object.notify() and java.lang.Object.wait(): The relation is unknow.

API Knowledge:
The available scenarios of java.sql.statement.executeUpdate: want to modify or update the data of database.
The unavailable scenarios of java.sql.statement.executeQuery: want to modify the database, such as with insert, update, or delete statements.
Relation between java.sql.statement.executeUpdate() and java.sql.statement.executeQuery(): java.sql.statement.executeUpdate() can modify and update the database. So the relation is function replace.

API Knowledge:
The available scenarios of java.util.Arrays.deepToString: need to print out a multi-dimensional array.
The unavailable scenarios of java.util.Arrays.toString: need to print out the elements of an array that is very large; print the elements of a multidimensional array.
Relation between java.util.Arrays.deepToString and java.util.Arrays.toString: java.util.Arrays.deepToString can print out a multi-dimensional array more easier. So the relation is function replace.

API Knowledge:
The available scenarios of java.time.LocalDate.isEqual(): want to compare two LocalDate objects to see if they represent the same date (ignoring the time of day).
The unavailable scenarios of java.util.Date.compareTo: want to compare two dates that are in different time zones; want to compare two dates that have different granularities.
Relation between java.time.LocalDate.isEqual() and java.util.Date.compareTo(): java.time.LocalDate.isEqual() also can not be used in the unusable scenarios of java.util.Date.compareTo(). So the relation is unkow.
