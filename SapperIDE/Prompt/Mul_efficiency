Choose the relation between the two APIs based on the knowledge of APIs.
Relations:
- function similarity: two API entities have similar usage.
- behavior difference: two API entities have similar usage and different behaves.
- function replace: one API entity can be replaced by another API entity in some specific condition.
- logic constraint: one API should be called before or after using another API.
- efficiency comparison: two API entity have efficiency comparison in some specific conditions.
- unknow: Not the above relation.

API Knowledge:
java.util.Hashset has fast search and insertion times due to its hashing algorithm; It is thread-safe and can be used in a multithreaded environment. It does not allow duplicate elements and does not maintain the order of the elements.
java.util.Treeset is a sorted set, the elements are stored in a sorted order. It allows for efficient search and insertion of elements. It may not be as fast as other set implementations; It does not allow for null elements; It is not thread-safe.
Relation between java.util.Hashset and java.util.Treeset: Compared with Treeset, Hashset is more faster. So the relation is efficiency comparison.

API Knowledge:
java.util.ArrayList can grow or shrink as needed; It allows for fast insertions and deletions at the end of the list; It provides fast access to elements using their index. It is not thread-safe; It uses more memory than linked lists; It is slower for insertions and deletions at the beginning or middle of the list.
java.util.LinkedList is generally slower than that of an array-based list; LinkedList is good for adding and removing at the beginning or end of a list, not for index-based access and searching.
Relation between java.util.ArrayList and java.util.LinkedList: Compared with LinkedList, ArrayList is more flexible and faster. So the relation is efficiency comparison.

API Knowledge:
java.util.Scanner is easy to use; it can parse complex input. java.util.Scanner is slower than other methods of input; It is not thread-safe.
java.util.Random is easy to use and generates random numbers quickly. It is not suitable for cryptographic or secure applications; It is not thread-safe.
Relation between java.util.Scanner and java.util.Random: The relation is unknow.

API Knowledge:
java.util.Random is easy to use and generates random numbers quickly. It is not suitable for cryptographic or secure applications; It is not thread-safe.
java.io.FileWriter allows for easy writing to a file; it can specify the file path and choose to append or overwrite the existing content. it cannot handle complex data structures like objects or arrays; it can not handle large files efficiently.
Relation between java.util.Random and java.io.FileWriter: The relation is unknow.

API Knowledge:
java.lang.StringBuffer is mutable; it can efficiently insert and delete characters from the buffer; StringBuffer is thread-safe; StringBuffer has a larger capacity than String. StringBuffer is slow; cannot change the capacity.
java.lang.StringBuilder is fast; it has useful methods for modifying strings. StringBuilder is not thread-safe and immutable.
Relation between java.lang.StringBuffer and java.lang.StringBuilder: Compared with Stack, Queue is more flexible. So the relation is efficiency comparison.
