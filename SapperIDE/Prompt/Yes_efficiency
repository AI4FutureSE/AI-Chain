Answer the question based on knowledge of APIs.

API Knowledge:
java.util.Hashset has fast search and insertion times due to its hashing algorithm; It is thread-safe and can be used in a multithreaded environment. It does not allow duplicate elements and does not maintain the order of the elements.
java.util.Treeset is a sorted set, the elements are stored in a sorted order. It allows for efficient search and insertion of elements. It may not be as fast as other set implementations; It does not allow for null elements; It is not thread-safe.
Q: Based on the knowledge above, do java.util.Hashset and java.util.Treeset have efficiency comparison?
A: Both Hashset and Treeset methods are used to store elements. Compared with Treeset, Hashset is more faster. So the answer is yes.

API Knowledge:
java.util.ArrayList can grow or shrink as needed; It allows for fast insertions and deletions at the end of the list; It provides fast access to elements using their index. It is not thread-safe; It uses more memory than linked lists; It is slower for insertions and deletions at the beginning or middle of the list.
java.util.LinkedList is generally slower than that of an array-based list; LinkedList is good for adding and removing at the beginning or end of a list, not for index-based access and searching.
Q: Based on the knowledge above, do java.util.ArrayList and java.util.LinkedList have efficiency comparison?
A: Compared with LinkedList, ArrayList is more flexible and faster. So the answer is yes.

API Knowledge:
java.util.Scanner is easy to use; it can parse complex input. java.util.Scanner is slower than other methods of input; It is not thread-safe.
java.util.Random is easy to use and generates random numbers quickly. It is not suitable for cryptographic or secure applications; It is not thread-safe.
Q: Based on the domain knowledge above, do java.util.Scanner and java.util.Random have efficiency comparison?
A: They don't have similar usage. So the answer is no.

API Knowledge:
java.util.Random is easy to use and generates random numbers quickly. It is not suitable for cryptographic or secure applications; It is not thread-safe.
java.io.FileWriter allows for easy writing to a file; it can specify the file path and choose to append or overwrite the existing content. it cannot handle complex data structures like objects or arrays; it can not handle large files efficiently.
Q: Based on the knowledge above, do java.util.Random and java.io.FileWriter have efficiency comparison?
A: They don't have similar usage. So the answer is no.

API Knowledge:
java.lang.StringBuffer is mutable; it can efficiently insert and delete characters from the buffer; StringBuffer is thread-safe; StringBuffer has a larger capacity than String. StringBuffer is slow; cannot change the capacity.
java.lang.StringBuilder is fast; it has useful methods for modifying strings. StringBuilder is not thread-safe and immutable.
Q: Based on the knowledge above, do java.lang.StringBuffer and java.lang.StringBuilder efficiency comparison?
A: Compared with Stack, Queue is more flexible. So the answer is yes.
