Answer the question based on knowledge of APIs.

API Knowledge:
The available scenarios of java.util.concurrent.BlockingQueue.take(): need to retrieve an element from a queue and wait if the queue is empty, it blocks until an element is available or until the specified timeout has elapsed.
The unavailable scenarios of java.util.concurrent.BlockingQueue.poll(): need to wait for an element to be available in the queue before retrieving it.
Q: Can java.util.concurrent.BlockingQueue.take() be used in the above unavailable scenarios of java.util.concurrent.BlockingQueue.poll()?
A: java.util.concurrent.BlockingQueue.take() can blocks until an element is available before retrieving it. So the answer is yes.

API Knowledge:
The available scenarios of java.lang.Object.notify(): want to wake up a single thread that is waiting on the object's monitor.
The unavailable scenarios of java.lang.Object.wait(): do not have the object's lock; do not want the current thread to be interrupted by another thread.
Q: Can java.lang.Object.notify() be used in the above unavailable scenarios of java.lang.Object.wait()?
A: java.lang.Object.notify() also can not be used in the unavailable scenarios of java.lang.Object.wait(). So the answer is no.

API Knowledge:
The available scenarios of java.sql.statement.executeUpdate: want to modify or update the data of database.
The unavailable scenarios of java.sql.statement.executeQuery: want to modify the database, such as with insert, update, or delete statements.
Q: Can java.sql.statement.executeUpdate() be used java.sql.statement.executeQuery() in the above unavailable scenarios of java.sql.statement.executeQuery?
A: java.sql.statement.executeUpdate() can modify and update the database. So the answer is yes.

API Knowledge:
The available scenarios of java.util.Arrays.deepToString: need to print out a multi-dimensional array.
The unavailable scenarios of java.util.Arrays.toString: need to print out the elements of an array that is very large; print the elements of a multidimensional array.
Q: Can java.util.Arrays.deepToString be used in the above unavailable scenarios of java.util.Arrays.toString?
A: java.util.Arrays.deepToString can print out a multi-dimensional array more easier. So the answer is yes.

API Knowledge:
The available scenarios of java.time.LocalDate.isEqual(): want to compare two LocalDate objects to see if they represent the same date (ignoring the time of day).
The unavailable scenarios of java.util.Date.compareTo: want to compare two dates that are in different time zones; want to compare two dates that have different granularities.
Q: Can java.time.LocalDate.isEqual() be used in the above unavailable scenarios of java.util.Date.compareTo()?
A: java.time.LocalDate.isEqual() also can not be used in the unavailable scenarios of java.util.Date.compareTo(). So the answer is no.
