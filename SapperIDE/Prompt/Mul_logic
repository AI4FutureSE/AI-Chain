Choose the relation between the two APIs based on the knowledge of APIs.
Relations:
- function similarity: two API entities have similar usage.
- behavior difference: two API entities have similar usage and different behaves.
- function replace: one API entity can be replaced by another API entity in some specific condition.
- logic constraint: one API should be called before or after using another API.
- efficiency comparison: two API entity have efficiency comparison in some specific conditions.
- unknow: Not the above relation.

API Knowledge:
java.lang.Object.notify() is used to wake up a single thread that is waiting on this object's monitor.
java.lang.Object.wait() is used to cause a thread to wait until it is notified or the specified amount of time has elapsed.
Before using java.lang.Object.notify(): ensure that you have acquired the lock on the object; you are waiting for a notification from the object. After using java.lang.Object.notify(): release the lock on the object to allow other threads to access it.
Before using java.lang.Object.wait(): you have acquired the lock on the object and set any necessary variables. After using java.lang.Object.wait(): release the lock on the object; stop or terminate the thread.
Relation between java.lang.Object.wait() and java.lang.Object.notify(): Before using java.lang.Object.notify() you should wait for a notification from the object using java.lang.Object.wait(). So the relation is logic constraint.

API Knowledge:
java.util.concurrent.BlockingQueue.take() is used to retrieve and remove the head of a queue, waiting if necessary until an element becomes available.
java.nio.channels.FileLock.release() is used to release a file lock that has been previously acquired.
Before using java.util.concurrent.BlockingQueue.take(): ensure that the queue is not empty. After using BlockingQueue.take(): If the BlockingQueue is empty after the take method is called, consider adding more elements to the queue.
Before using java.nio.channels.FileLock.release(): you have acquired the lock on the file you want to release. After using FileLock.release(): check if the lock was successfully released by checking the return value.
Relation between java.util.concurrent.BlockingQueue.take() and java.nio.channels.FileLock.release(): The relation is unknow.

API Knowledge:
java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass() is used to load a class with a specified name and return the resulting Class object.
java.lang.Class.forName() is used to load a class at runtime.
Before using java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass():have the necessary permissions to access the class; load is available on the classpath. After using java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(): ensure that you have properly handled any exceptions; ensure that you have properly handled any exceptions.
Before using java.lang.Class.forName(): have the correct name of the class you want to load; have sufficient privileges to access the class. After using java.lang.Class.forName(): check for any exceptions that may have been thrown; close any resources that may have been opened.
Relation between java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass() and java.lang.Class.forName(): Both java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass() and java.lang.Class.forName() can be used to load a class at runtime, they do not have logical order. So the relation is function similarity.

API Knowledge:
java.lang.Thread.join() allows one thread to wait for the completion of another thread.
java.lang.Thread.isAlive() determines whether a thread is still running or not.
Before using java.lang.Thread.join(): ensure the thread you want to join has been started and is not already joined. After using java.lang.Thread.join(): check the return value of the join() method to determine if the Thread has completed.
Before using java.lang.Thread.isAlive(): have a reference to a Thread object; start the Thread or interrupt the Thread. After using java.lang.Thread.isAlive(): start„ÄÅinterrupt or wait a thread.
Relation between java.lang.Thread.join() and java.lang.Thread.isAlive(): You need to use java.lang.Thread.isAlive() to check thread's status, if the thread is still alive, then use the java.lang.Thread.join() to wait for the thread to finish. So the relation is logic constraint.

API Knowledge:
java.io.FileWriter is used to read character streams from a source.
java.io.FileReader is used to construct a string from the characters.
Before using java.io.FileWriter: you have the necessary permissions to write to the file you are trying to access; make sure that the file you are trying to write to exists, or create a new file if necessary. After using java.lang.Thread.run(): close the file to ensure that all data has been written to the file and to free up resources used by the FileWriter.
Before using java.io.FileReader: make sure that the file you are trying to read exists and that you have the necessary permissions to read it. After using java.lang.Thread.start(): close the FileReader object to release any resources it was using.
Relation between java.io.FileWriter and java.io.FileReader: StringBuilder can be used to construct a string from the characters read by the Reader. So the relation is logic constraint.
